## Constructor

The constructor accepts a partial `User` object and uses it to initialize the properties of a new `User` instance. It applies default values where necessary and ensures that certain properties, like `meta` and `address`, are initialized even if not provided.

```typescript
constructor(data: Partial<User> = {}) {
  Object.assign(this, data);
  this.meta = this.meta || {};
  this.address = data.address ? { ...this.address, ...data.address } : this.address;
}
```

## Usage

The `User` class is used throughout the application to create, manage, and interact with user data. It provides a consistent structure for user information, making it easier to handle user-related operations and ensuring that data integrity is maintained across different components of the application.

The class can be extended or modified to include additional fields and methods as needed, providing flexibility to adapt to changing requirements.

The `setupForms` method initializes the form structure with various nested groups such as `recipientInfo`, `physicalAddress`, `demographics`, etc. Each form control is equipped with appropriate validators.

```typescript
setupForms() {
  this.consentForm = this.fb.group({
    schoolId: [{ value: '', disabled: false }, [Validators.required, this.schoolObjectValidator()]],
    recipientInfo: this.fb.group({
      lastName: [{ value: '', disabled: false }, Validators.required],
      firstName: [{ value: '', disabled: false }, Validators.required],
      // ...
    }),
    // Additional form groups...
  });
}
```

### Signature Handling

Signature pads are managed through various methods such as `setupSignaturePad`, `clearSignature`, and `drawComplete`. These methods ensure that signatures are correctly captured, displayed, and validated.

### Data Handling

- **Data Fetching:** The `getConsentFormData` method retrieves existing form data by form ID, useful for editing functionality.

# SignaturePad Directive Documentation

The `SignaturePadDirective` is an Angular directive that integrates the `signature_pad` library to enable capturing and managing user signatures within an Angular application. This directive is designed to be used in forms, providing a seamless way to capture, display, and manage signatures.

## Table of Contents

1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Usage](#usage)
3. [Inputs](#inputs)
4. [Public Methods](#public-methods)
5. [ControlValueAccessor Implementation](#controlvalueaccessor-implementation)
6. [Event Management](#event-management)
7. [Mobile Responsiveness](#mobile-responsiveness)
8. [Example](#example)

## Overview

The `SignaturePadDirective` provides a simple interface for capturing signature input via a canvas element. It uses the `signature_pad` library to handle the drawing and export of signatures as data URLs. The directive is equipped to handle changes in screen size, making it responsive and suitable for both desktop and mobile views.

## Usage

To use the `SignaturePadDirective`, add the directive to a canvas element within your component template:

```html
<canvas appSignaturePad [options]="signatureOptions"></canvas>
```

### Inputs

- **options**: Object containing configuration options for the `signature_pad`. This can include settings like `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `penColor`, etc.

- **isDisabled**: Boolean input to enable or disable the signature pad. When true, the pad is read-only.

## Public Methods

- **clear()**: Clears the current drawing on the signature pad.

- **toDataURL()**: Returns the current drawing as a data URL.

- **fromDataURL(dataURL: string)**: Loads a drawing from a data URL.

- **registerSignaturePadListener(listener: () => void)**: Registers a listener function that will be called whenever the user finishes a stroke.

## ControlValueAccessor Implementation

The directive implements the `ControlValueAccessor` interface, allowing it to be used with Angular forms:

- **writeValue(value: any)**: Writes a value to the component. If a data URL is provided, it will load the signature from the URL.

- **registerOnChange(fn: any)**: Registers a function to call when the input changes.

- **registerOnTouched(fn: any)**: Registers a function to call when the input is touched.

- **setDisabledState(isDisabled: boolean)**: Sets the disabled state of the directive.

## Event Management

- **handleEndStroke()**: This function is triggered when the user finishes a stroke on the pad, updating the form control value with the current data URL.

## Mobile Responsiveness

The directive uses `LayoutService` to adjust the canvas size based on screen size, maintaining responsiveness across devices:

```typescript
this.screenSizeSubscription = this.layoutService.isHandset().subscribe((isHandset) => {
    this.isMobileView = isHandset;
    canvas.width = canvas.offsetWidth;
    canvas.height = canvas.offsetHeight;
});
```

## Example

```html
<canvas appSignaturePad 
        [options]="{ minWidth: 1, maxWidth: 2, penColor: 'rgb(66, 133, 244)' }" 
        [isDisabled]="false"></canvas>
```

This example shows a canvas with a signature pad attached. The pen uses a specific color, and the pad is enabled for drawing.

---

The `SignaturePadDirective` is a powerful tool for integrating signature capture into Angular applications, providing flexibility and customization to suit various use cases.

1. **Dialog Title**
   - Displays either "Create District" or "Update District" based on the mode of operation.
   - Utilizes Angular's `*ngIf` directive to toggle between creation and update modes.

2. **Loading State**
   - A loading spinner is displayed when the component is in a loading state, i.e., when an HTTP request is being processed.
   ```html
   <div class="loading-container" *ngIf="loading">
       <app-loading [fullScreen]="true"></app-loading>
   </div>
   ```

3. **Form Structure**
   - The form is initialized using Angular's reactive form module.
   - `formGroup` directive is used to bind the form to the `districtForm` object defined in the component TypeScript file.
   - Includes a single input field for the district name, which is a required field.
   ```html
   <mat-form-field appearance="outline">
       <mat-label>District Name</mat-label>
       <input matInput formControlName="name" type="text" />
       <mat-error *ngIf="districtForm.get('name')!.hasError('required')">
           District Name is required
       </mat-error>
   </mat-form-field>
   ```

4. **Action Buttons**
   - Includes "Cancel" and "Submit" buttons.
   - The submit button's label changes based on the operation mode (Create/Update).
   - The cancel button uses the `(click)` event to trigger the `onCancel()` method, which closes the dialog without submitting the form.
   ```html
   <div mat-dialog-actions align="end" *ngIf="!loading" class="action-buttons mr-10">
       <div>
           <button mat-raised-button type="button" (click)="onCancel()">Cancel</button>
       </div>
       <div class="ml-3">
           <button mat-raised-button class="submit-button" color="primary" type="submit">
               {{ isEditMode ? 'Update' : 'Create' }}
           </button>
       </div>
   </div>
   ```

- **LayoutService**: Provides information about the current layout, specifically whether the view is mobile or not.
- **SideNavBarService**: Manages the state of the sidebar, allowing it to be toggled open or closed.
- **Router**: Angular service for navigation within the application.

## Properties

| Property               | Type        | Description                                           |
|------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `screenSizeSubscription` | `Subscription` | Subscribes to changes in screen size.                  |
| `currentUrl`           | `string`    | Holds the current URL for context, not actively used. |
| `isMobileView`         | `boolean`   | Indicates whether the view is on a mobile device.     |

## Methods

### `ngOnInit()`

Initializes the component by setting up a subscription to monitor the device's screen size. This subscription helps in determining if the current view is mobile.

```typescript
ngOnInit(): void {
    this.screenSizeSubscription = this.layoutService.isHandset().subscribe((isHandset) => {
        this.isMobileView = isHandset;
    });
}
```

### `ngOnDestroy()`

Cleans up the component by unsubscribing from the screen size subscription to prevent memory leaks.

```typescript
ngOnDestroy(): void {
    if (this.screenSizeSubscription) {
        this.screenSizeSubscription.unsubscribe();
    }
}
```

### `onToggleSidebar()`

Toggles the visibility of the sidebar. This method is typically used in mobile views to provide a collapsible navigation menu.

```typescript
onToggleSidebar() {
    this.sideNavBarService.toggleSidebar();
}
```

### `goTo(target: string)`

Navigates to a specified route within the application.

```typescript
goTo(target = '') {
    this.router.navigateByUrl(`/${target}`);
}
```

## Usage

The `HeaderComponent` is primarily used for rendering the application's header. It dynamically adjusts its layout based on the screen size, and it provides navigation capabilities and user authentication actions (e.g., logout).

## Example

Here‚Äôs how you might include the `HeaderComponent` in a template:

```html
<app-header></app-header>
```

This component ties into the larger application structure to provide a cohesive and responsive user experience. It's a critical part of the application's navigation and layout management.

# Create/Update School Dialog Component Documentation

The `create-update-school-dialog.component.html` file is an Angular template for a dialog component used to create or update school records in an application. This dialog provides a form for inputting school details and selecting the corresponding district.

## Overview

The component consists of a form that allows users to create or update school information. The form includes fields for the school's name and its associated district. The dialog is designed to be responsive to both desktop and mobile views.

## HTML Structure

### Container and Headers

- **Dialog Container**: The main wrapper for the dialog content is a `div` with the class `dialog`, which serves as the main container for the dialog content.
- **Title**: The title of the dialog is displayed as either "Create School" or "Update School" based on the `isEditMode` state.

```html
<h1 mat-dialog-title class="content-title">
  {{ isEditMode ? 'Update School' : 'Create School' }}
</h1>
```

### Loading Indicator

- The component includes a loading indicator that displays a spinner while data is being fetched. It is conditionally rendered using `*ngIf="loading"`.

```html
<div class="loading-container" *ngIf="loading">
  <app-loading [fullScreen]="true"></app-loading>
</div>
```

### Form

- **Form Element**: The form is displayed conditionally when `loading` is `false`. It uses Angular's `ReactiveFormsModule` for validation.

#### Form Fields

- **School Name**: A text input field for entering the name of the school. It is a required field, and appropriate error messages are displayed if the field is invalid.

```html
<mat-form-field class="pr-10" appearance="outline">
  <mat-label>School Name</mat-label>
  <input matInput formControlName="name" type="text" />
  <mat-error *ngIf="schoolForm.get('name')!.hasError('required')">
    School Name is required
  </mat-error>
</mat-form-field>
```

- **District**: A dropdown selection for choosing the district the school belongs to. This is also a required field, and an error message is shown if the field is not filled.

```html
<mat-form-field appearance="outline">
  <mat-label>District</mat-label>
  <mat-select formControlName="district">
    <mat-option *ngFor="let district of districts" [value]="district._id">
      {{ district.name }}
    </mat-option>
  </mat-select>
  <mat-error *ngIf="schoolForm.get('district')!.hasError('required')">
    District is required
  </mat-error>
</mat-form-field>
```

### Form Actions

- **Cancel Button**: A button to cancel the operation and close the dialog without submitting the form. It is important that this button has a `type="button"` to prevent accidental form submission.

```html
<button mat-raised-button type="button" (click)="onCancel()">Cancel</button>
```

- **Submit Button**: A button to submit the form. The text on the button changes between "Create" and "Update" depending on whether the dialog is in edit mode.

```html
<button mat-raised-button class="submit-button" color="primary" type="submit">
  {{ isEditMode ? 'Update' : 'Create' }}
</button>
```

## Styling

- The template uses Angular Material components for the form fields, buttons, and dialog structure.
- Classes like `display-flex`, `flex-direction-row`, and others are used to handle layout styles for responsiveness.

## Summary

This component provides a user-friendly interface for managing school data, with real-time validation and responsive design to ensure accessibility across different devices. The form is straightforward, with minimal fields to ensure quick data entry and modification for school records.

The `app.routing.ts` file defines the application's routes, including their paths, associated components, and any guards used to protect certain routes. It also sets router options to enhance the user experience, such as maintaining scroll positions.

## Key Components

### Imports

- **Angular Core & Router**: 
  - `ModuleWithProviders`, `RouterModule`, `Routes`, `ExtraOptions` are imported to set up the routing.
- **Environment**: 
  - The `environment` import is used to determine the default component based on the environment configuration.
- **Components**: 
  - Various components from different modules (auth-module and feature-module) are imported for routing.
- **Guards**: 
  - `authGuard` is used to secure routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain paths.

### Router Options

- **onSameUrlNavigation**: Set to `'reload'` to allow reloading of the current route.
- **scrollPositionRestoration**: Set to `'enabled'` to restore the scroll position on navigation.
- **anchorScrolling**: Enabled to allow scrolling to anchors within the page.

### Default Component

The default component is set based on the environment configuration:
- **LoginComponent**: Used if the default component is set to `'consent-form-influenza'`.
- **GetStartedComponent**: Used otherwise.

### Routes Configuration

The `routes` array defines the path-to-component mappings:

#### Root Redirection

- Redirects from `''` to `'/'`.

#### Basic Layout

- **Component**: `BasicLayoutComponent`
- **Guard**: `authGuard` (applies to child routes)
- **Child Routes**:
  - `login`: Renders `LoginComponent`.
  - `password-reset`: Renders `PasswordResetComponent`.
  - `password-reset/:token`: Renders `PasswordResetComponent` with a token parameter.
  - `consent-form-influenza`: Renders `ConsentFormComponent`.

#### Side Navigation Layout

- **Component**: `SideNavLayoutComponent`
- **Guard**: `authGuard` (applies to child routes)
- **Child Routes**:
  - `dashboard`: Renders `DashboardComponent`.
  - `forms`: Renders `ConsentFormsComponent`.
  - `consent-form/:id`: Renders `ConsentFormComponent` with an ID parameter.
  - `image-consent-form/create`: Renders `ConsentFormWithImageComponent`.
  - `image-consent-form/create-and-complete`: Renders `ConsentFormWithImageComponent`.
  - `consent-form/update/:form_id`: Renders `ConsentFormWithImageComponent` for updating forms.
  - `print-form/:formId`: Renders `PrintConsentFormComponent`.
  - `users`: Renders `UsersComponent`.
  - `schools`: Renders `SchoolsComponent`.
  - `districts`: Renders `DistrictsComponent`.
  - `reports`: Renders `ReportsComponent`.

#### Fallback

- Any unspecified path (`'**'`) redirects to `login`.

### Export

The `routing` constant is exported using `RouterModule.forRoot()`, which initializes the router with the defined routes and options.

## Conclusion

This routing configuration enables a structured navigation throughout the application, ensuring that users are directed to the appropriate components based on their actions and authentication status. By using guards and setting router options, the application can maintain a smooth and secure user experience.

# CapitalizeFirstPipe Documentation

## Overview
The `CapitalizeFirstPipe` is an Angular pipe designed to transform camelCase strings into a more human-readable format by splitting words and capitalizing the first letter of the resulting sentence. This pipe is particularly useful for formatting component names or data properties that follow camelCase naming conventions, making them more understandable in the user interface.

## Usage
This pipe can be used in Angular templates to transform and display camelCase strings into a more readable format. It can be applied directly within interpolation or attribute bindings in your HTML templates.

### Example
```html
<p>{{ 'camelCaseExample' | capitalizeFirst }}</p>
```
The above usage will transform and display as: `Camel Case Example`.

## Implementation Details

### Pipe Definition
```typescript
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({ name: 'capitalizeFirst' })
export class CapitalizeFirstPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    if (!value) return value;
    
    // Split the camelCase into separate words
    const result = value.replace(/([A-Z])/g, ' $1');
    
    // Capitalize the first letter of the result
    const capitalized = result.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + result.slice(1);
    return capitalized;
  }
}
```

### Key Functionalities
- **Splitting CamelCase:** The pipe uses a regular expression to identify uppercase letters within a string and inserts a space before each one. This effectively splits the camelCase string into separate words.
- **Capitalization:** After splitting, the first letter of the entire result is capitalized to ensure proper sentence casing.
- **Handling Edge Cases:** If the input value is `null` or an empty string, the pipe simply returns the value without any transformation.

## Benefits
- **Readability:** Makes camelCase strings more user-friendly by adding spaces and capitalizing the first letter.
- **Reusability:** Can be reused across multiple components and templates within the Angular application.
- **Simplicity:** Provides a simple and effective way to enhance the presentation of camelCase data properties in the UI.

## Conclusion
The `CapitalizeFirstPipe` is a handy tool for formatting camelCase strings into a more understandable format. It is easy to use and integrate into Angular applications, enhancing the clarity of displayed data with minimal effort.

# Documentation for `format-datepicker.ts`

This documentation provides an overview and explanation of the `format-datepicker.ts` file, which customizes the date formats used in Angular Material datepickers. This file is crucial for applications that require custom date formats when using Angular Material's datepicker component.

## Overview

The `format-datepicker.ts` consists of a custom date adapter class named `AppDateAdapter` that extends the `NativeDateAdapter` provided by Angular Material. This extension allows for custom formatting of dates, specifically for display in input fields. The file also defines a set of date formats under the constant `APP_DATE_FORMATS`.

## Code Breakdown

### Import Statements

- **NativeDateAdapter** and **MatDateFormats**: These are imported from `@angular/material/core` and are essential for creating a custom date adapter.
- **Injectable**: Imported from `@angular/core`, this decorator marks the `AppDateAdapter` as a service that can be injected into other parts of the application.

### Custom Date Adapter: `AppDateAdapter`

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AppDateAdapter extends NativeDateAdapter {
  override format(date: Date, displayFormat: string): string {
    if (displayFormat === 'input') {
      let day: string = date.getDate().toString();
      day = +day < 10 ? '0' + day : day;
      let month: string = (date.getMonth() + 1).toString();
      month = +month < 10 ? '0' + month : month;
      const year = date.getFullYear();
      return `${month}/${day}/${year}`;
    }
    return date.toDateString();
  }
}
```

- **Purpose**: The `AppDateAdapter` class is responsible for overriding the default format method of the `NativeDateAdapter`.
- **Method - `format`**:
  - **Parameters**:
    - `date: Date`: The date object to be formatted.
    - `displayFormat: string`: The format type, which in this implementation, checks specifically for the 'input' format.
  - **Functionality**: 
    - When the `displayFormat` is 'input', the date is formatted as `MM/DD/YYYY`.
    - If the `displayFormat` is not 'input', it defaults to using the `Date.toDateString()` method.

### Date Format Constants: `APP_DATE_FORMATS`

```typescript
export const APP_DATE_FORMATS: MatDateFormats = {
  parse: {
    dateInput: { month: 'short', year: 'numeric', day: 'numeric' },
  },
  display: {
    dateInput: 'input',
    monthYearLabel: { year: 'numeric', month: 'numeric' },
    dateA11yLabel: { year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' },
    monthYearA11yLabel: { year: 'numeric', month: 'long' },
  },
};
```

- **Purpose**: The `APP_DATE_FORMATS` constant defines custom parsing and display formats for dates.
- **Structure**:
  - **parse**: Specifies how the date input should be parsed. Here, it's set to use a short month, numeric year, and numeric day.
  - **display**: Specifies various display formats:
    - `dateInput`: Uses 'input' which refers to the custom format defined in `AppDateAdapter`.
    - `monthYearLabel`, `dateA11yLabel`, `monthYearA11yLabel`: These provide custom formats for accessibility and month/year label display.

## Usage

To use these custom date formats, you need to provide the `AppDateAdapter` and `APP_DATE_FORMATS` in your Angular module where you configure Angular Material's datepicker.

```typescript
import { APP_DATE_FORMATS, AppDateAdapter } from './path-to/format-datepicker';

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    { provide: DateAdapter, useClass: AppDateAdapter },
    { provide: MAT_DATE_FORMATS, useValue: APP_DATE_FORMATS },
  ],
})
export class YourModule {}
```

## Conclusion

The `format-datepicker.ts` file is a straightforward yet powerful configuration for managing date formats in Angular Material applications. By customizing date display formats, it enhances user experience and ensures that date inputs align with project requirements.

# Documentation for `header.component.ts`

The `header.component.ts` file is an Angular component that defines the logic and metadata for the header section of the application. This component is part of the shared module and is used to display the header across the application.

## Overview

The header component acts as a reusable UI component that can be included in different parts of the application to provide a consistent top navigation bar or header section.

## Component Decorator

The `@Component` decorator is used to define the metadata for the component. It specifies the selector, template URL, and style URLs for the component.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',
  templateUrl: './header.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./header.component.scss'],
})
```

### Properties of the Decorator

- **selector**: `'app-header'`  
  This defines the custom HTML tag that can be used in the templates to include this component.

- **templateUrl**: `'./header.component.html'`  
  Specifies the path to the HTML template file for the component. This file contains the structure and layout of the header.

### Styling and Responsiveness

The component is styled to be responsive using Angular Flex Layout directives (`fxLayout`, `fxLayoutAlign`, `fxLayoutGap`) to ensure it adapts well across different screen sizes.

## Conclusion

The `header.component.html` provides a structured and styled header component utilizing Angular Material and Flex Layout for a responsive design. It includes placeholders for navigation and user menu, which can be expanded with functional logic as needed.

# Loading Component Documentation

The **LoadingComponent** is a simple Angular component used to display a loading indicator, often used to indicate that a process is ongoing or data is being fetched. This component can be configured to either cover the full screen or a specific part of the screen, enhancing user experience during data loading times.

## Component Overview

### Selector
- **`app-loading`**

### Purpose
- Display a loading spinner.
- Indicate ongoing processes like data fetching or processing.

### Key Features
- Configurable to be full-screen or contained within its parent element.
- Simple and lightweight, suitable for various parts of the application.

## Properties

| Property   | Type    | Default     | Description                                        |
|------------|---------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `fullScreen` | `boolean` | `false`     | Determines if the loading indicator should cover the full screen or just its container. |

## Usage

The component is primarily used within other components to provide visual feedback during asynchronous operations. Below is an example of how to use the **LoadingComponent** within a template:

```html
<!-- Usage in a template, assuming async operation is in progress -->
<app-loading [fullScreen]="true"></app-loading>
```

### Example Scenario

Suppose you have a data-intensive operation, such as fetching user data from a remote server. You can use the **LoadingComponent** to inform users that the application is processing their request.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-data',
  template: `
    <div *ngIf="loading">
      <app-loading [fullScreen]="true"></app-loading>
    </div>
    <div *ngIf="!loading">
      <!-- User data content -->
    </div>
  `,
  styleUrls: ['./user-data.component.scss']
})
export class UserDataComponent {
  loading = true;

  // Assume fetchData() is a method that fetches data from a server
  fetchData() {
    // Simulate async operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.loading = false;
    }, 3000);
  }
}
```

## Design Considerations

- **Accessibility**: Use ARIA roles and attributes if necessary to ensure that the loading component is accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
-

# Loading Component HTML Documentation

The `loading.component.html` file defines the structure for a loading spinner component in an Angular application. This component is used to visually indicate to users that a process or page is loading. Below, you'll find a detailed explanation of its structure and functionality.

## Overview

The loading component consists of a single `div` element that conditionally applies a CSS class based on the component's `fullScreen` property. Within this `div`, there is a Material Design progress spinner that serves as the visual indicator of loading.

## HTML Structure

```html
<div [ngClass]="{ 'full-screen': fullScreen }">
  <mat-progress-spinner
    color="primary"
    diameter="50"
    mode="indeterminate"
    aria-label="Page is loading"
  >
  </mat-progress-spinner>
</div>
```

### Elements and Attributes

- **Div Element**: 
  - The outer `div` is used to contain the spinner and potentially apply styling that makes the spinner cover the full screen if the `fullScreen` input is set to `true`.

- **ngClass Directive**:
  - `[ngClass]="{ 'full-screen': fullScreen }"`: This Angular directive dynamically adds the `full-screen` class to the `div` if the `fullScreen` property is `true`. This is useful for styling the spinner to cover the entire screen.

- **mat-progress-spinner**:
  - `color="primary"`: Sets the spinner's color to the primary theme color.
  - `diameter="50"`: Sets the diameter of the spinner to 50 pixels, controlling its size.
  - `mode="indeterminate"`: The spinner continuously animates, indicating an ongoing process with no definite endpoint.
  - `aria-label="Page is loading"`: Provides an accessible label for screen readers, indicating that the page is loading.

## Usage

This component is intended to be used wherever a loading indicator is needed in the application. It can be placed within other components or views to show a loading state.

### Example Usage

```html
<app-loading [fullScreen]="true"></app-loading>
```

In the example above, the loading spinner will cover the entire screen, useful for global loading states like page transitions or data fetching.

## Styling

The component relies on CSS classes to control its appearance. For instance, the `full-screen` class would be defined in the component's CSS file (`loading.component.scss`) to apply styles that position the spinner in the center of the screen and ensure it covers the full viewport.

By using Angular Material's `mat-progress-spinner`, the component benefits from Material Design aesthetics, ensuring consistency with other Material components in the application.

| `username`             | `String`                | Unique identifier for the medical professional.  | Yes      |
| `password`             | `String`                | Hashed password for authentication.              | Yes      |
| `email`                | `String`                | Unique email address for communication.          | Yes      |
| `resetPasswordToken`   | `String`                | Token for password reset functionality.          | No       |
| `resetPasswordExpires` | `String`                | Expiry time for the password reset token.        | No       |
| `phn`                  | `Schema.Types.ObjectId` | Reference to a PHN (Public Health Nurse) object. | Yes      |

```javascript
const MedicalProfessionalSchema = new Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  resetPasswordToken: { type: String },
  resetPasswordExpires: { type: String },
  phn: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'PHN', required: true },
});
```

---

### Middleware

The schema includes pre-save middleware to hash the password whenever it is modified. This enhances security by storing only hashed passwords in the database.

```javascript
MedicalProfessionalSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {
  if (this.isModified('password')) {
    this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 8);
  }
  next();
});
```

- **Pre-save Middleware:** Automatically hashes the password before saving the document if the password field is modified.

---

### Instance Methods

An instance method `comparePassword` is provided to compare a plain text password with the hashed password stored in the database.

```javascript
MedicalProfessionalSchema.methods.comparePassword = async function (password) {
  return bcrypt.compare(password, this.password);
};
```

- **comparePassword:** Compares a given password with the stored hashed password, using bcrypt for comparison.

---

### Exporting the Model

Finally, the schema is compiled into a model and exported for use within the application.

```javascript
module.exports = mongoose.model(
  'MedicalProfessional',
  MedicalProfessionalSchema,
);
```

- **Model Export:** Allows the `MedicalProfessional` model to be used in other parts of the application, facilitating CRUD operations on Medical Professional documents.

---

### Conclusion

The `MedicalProfessional.js` file plays a crucial role in managing the authentication and identification of medical professionals within the system. The integration of password hashing ensures that user credentials are stored securely, maintaining the integrity and privacy of sensitive information.

# üìÑ Documentation for `District.js`

This document provides an in-depth overview of the `District.js` file, which is part of the Wellbility State School Backend project. This file is essential for managing district-related data within the MongoDB database using Mongoose, a popular ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## üìö Index

1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Dependencies](#dependencies)
3. [Schema Definition](#schema-definition)
4. [Mongoose Paginate Plugin](#mongoose-paginate-plugin)
5. [Exporting the Model](#exporting-the-model)

## Overview

The `District.js` file is responsible for defining the data model for a "District" in the application. This model is used to manage and interact with district data stored in a MongoDB database. Each district has a unique name, and the model supports pagination to handle large sets of data efficiently.

## Dependencies

The file imports two main dependencies:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const mongoosePaginate = require('mongoose-paginate-v2');
```

- **Mongoose**: A library that provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data. It allows defining schemas and interacting with MongoDB database.
- **Mongoose Paginate**: A pagination library for Mongoose that provides pagination capabilities to the data model.

## Schema Definition

The `DistrictSchema` defines the structure of a district document in the database:

```javascript
const DistrictSchema = new Schema(
  {
    name: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  },
  { timestamps: true },
);
```

- **name**: A required string field that must be unique. It represents the name of the district.

- **timestamps**: An option that automatically adds `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to the schema, storing the creation and update times of each document.

## Mongoose Paginate Plugin

The `mongoose-paginate-v2` plugin is added to the `DistrictSchema` to enable pagination:

```javascript
DistrictSchema.plugin(mongoosePaginate);
```

This plugin allows for easy implementation of pagination when querying the District model, making it efficient to handle large amounts of data by retrieving data in chunks.

## Exporting the Model

Finally, the model is exported for use in other parts of the application:

```javascript
module.exports = mongoose.model('District', DistrictSchema);
```

This line creates and exports a Mongoose model named `District` based on the `DistrictSchema`. This model can be used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on district documents in the MongoDB database.

---

This concludes the documentation for the `District.js` file. This backend component plays a crucial role in managing district data, ensuring data integrity and efficient data retrieval through pagination. üè´üìä

| Field Name             | Type                | Required | Unique | Description                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `username`             | `String`            | Yes      | Yes    | The unique username for the nurse.                               |
| `password`             | `String`            | Yes      | No     | The nurse's password, which will be hashed.                      |
| `email`                | `String`            | Yes      | Yes    | The unique email address for the nurse.                          |
| `resetPasswordToken`   | `String`            | No       | No     | Token for password reset functionality.                          |
| `resetPasswordExpires` | `String`            | No       | No     | Expiry time for the reset password token.                        |
| `schools`              | `Array of ObjectId` | Yes      | No     | Array of references to the schools the nurse is associated with. |

### Schools Association

- **Type**: Array of `ObjectId`
- **Reference**: `School`
- **Purpose**: To associate a nurse with multiple schools.

## Middleware

A **pre-save middleware** is used to hash the nurse's password before saving it to the database. This ensures that plaintext passwords are never stored directly in the database.

```javascript
NurseSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {
  if (this.isModified('password')) {
    this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 8);
  }
  next();
});
```

- **`isModified('password')`**: Checks if the password has been modified. Hashing is only performed if the password has changed.
- **`bcrypt.hash(this.password, 8)`**: Uses bcrypt to hash the password with a salt factor of 8.

## Instance Methods

The `Nurse` schema defines an instance method for password comparison:

```javascript
NurseSchema.methods.comparePassword = async function (password) {
  return bcrypt.compare(password, this.password);
};
```

- **`comparePassword`**: Compares a given password with the hashed password stored in the database using bcrypt's compare method. This is typically used during the login process.

## Export

Finally, the `Nurse` model is exported for use in other parts of the application.

```javascript
module.exports = mongoose.model('Nurse', NurseSchema);
```

By exporting the model, it can be imported and utilized in controllers and other modules that handle nurse-related logic and database operations.

## Plugins üîå

### Pagination

The `mongoose-paginate-v2` plugin is applied to the schema to enable pagination functionality:

```javascript
UserSchema.plugin(mongoosePaginate);
```

## Methods üîç

### comparePassword

A method for comparing a candidate password with the stored hashed password. It uses `bcrypt.compare` to ensure secure password verification.

```javascript
UserSchema.methods.comparePassword = function (candidatePassword) {
  return bcrypt.compare(candidatePassword, this.password);
};
```

## Export üì§

The file exports the **User** model, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

```javascript
module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

## Summary üìù

# Documentation for `PublicLinkController.js`

This file is part of the backend system for the Wellbility State School, implemented using Node.js and Express. It defines a controller for managing public links associated with consent forms, facilitating secure access and interaction between parents and the school system.

## Overview

The `PublicLinkController` handles the creation and management of public links that are used to share consent forms with parents. This controller ensures that each link is unique and has an expiration time, enhancing security and data integrity.

## Functions

### 1. Generate a Random Link

```javascript
const generateLink = () => {
  return crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
};
```

- **Purpose**: Generates a unique, random string using the `crypto` module. This link is used as the identifier in the URL for accessing the consent form.
- **Usage**: Internally used within the controller to ensure each public link is unique.

### 2. Create a Public Link

```javascript
exports.createPublicLink = async (req, res) => { ... }
```

- **Purpose**: Handles the creation of a public link for a given parent and consent form. The link is valid for 24 hours.
- **Parameters**:
  - `req.body.parentId`: The ID of the parent for whom the link is being created.
  - `req.body.consentFormId`: The ID of the consent form to be shared.
- **Process**:
  1. **Validation**: Checks if the parent and consent form exist.
  2. **Link Reuse**: Searches for an existing non-expired link. If found, returns this link instead of creating a new one.
  3. **Link Creation**: If no valid link exists, a new link is generated with a 24-hour expiry.
  4. **Database Updates**: Saves the new link in the `PublicLink` collection and associates it with the parent.
  5. **Email Notification**: Sends an email to the parent with the newly created link.
- **Response**:
  - **Success**: Returns the public link object with a status of `201 Created`.
  - **Errors**: Handles errors by returning a `500 Internal Server Error` with an error message.

## Dependencies

- **Models**:
  - `PublicLink`: Manages the public link data.
  - `Parent`: Represents the parent entity, maintaining a list of associated public links.
  - `ConsentForm`: Represents the consent form entity linked with the public link.
- **Utilities**:
  - **Crypto**: Used for generating a random hash for the link.
  - **SendGrid Config**: Utilized for sending email notifications to parents.

## Code Snippet

Here is the complete function for creating a public link, which includes validation, creation, and email notification:

```javascript
exports.createPublicLink = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { parentId, consentFormId } = req.body;
    const parent = await Parent.findById(parentId);
    const consentForm = await ConsentForm.findById(consentFormId);

    if (!parent || !consentForm) {
      return res
        .status(404)
        .json({ message: 'Parent or ConsentForm not found' });
    }

    const existingLink = await PublicLink.findOne({
      parentId,
      consentFormId,
      expiryTime: { $gt: new Date() },
    });
    if (existingLink) {
      return res.status(200).json(existingLink);
    }

    const link = generateLink();
    const expiryTime = new Date();
    expiryTime.setHours(expiryTime.getHours() + 24);

    const publicLink = new PublicLink({
      parentId,
      consentFormId,
      link,
      expiryTime,
    });
    await publicLink.save();

    parent.links.push(publicLink._id);
    await parent.save();

    const templateId = 'd-886de40787e44f95ab43e7e5e4b54f33';
    const data = { publicLink: link };
    await sendToParent(parent.email, templateId, data);

    res.status(201).json(publicLink);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error creating public link', error });
  }
};
```

## Conclusion

The `PublicLinkController.js` efficiently manages the lifecycle of public links, ensuring secure and temporary access to sensitive information like consent forms. The integration with email services ensures that parents are promptly notified, enhancing the communication process within the school system.

# Documentation for `authMiddleware.js`

The `authMiddleware.js` is a middleware module designed to handle authentication in an Express.js application using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This middleware ensures that only authenticated users can access certain routes by verifying the JWT provided in the request headers.

## üìù File Overview

- **Filename**: authMiddleware.js
- **Purpose**: To authenticate and authorize users by verifying JWT tokens in incoming requests.

## üìë Key Features

- **Token Extraction**: Extracts the token from the request `Authorization` header.
- **Token Verification**: Verifies the token using `jsonwebtoken` to ensure it is valid and not expired.
- **Database Check**: Confirms the token exists in the database and has not expired.
- **User Authentication**: Attaches the decoded user information to the request object for downstream middleware and route handlers.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful responses in case of missing, invalid, or expired tokens.

## üìú Code Explanation

Here is a breakdown of the code and its functionality:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const Token = require('../models/Token');

const verifyToken = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    // Get the token from the request headers
    const authorizationHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
    if (!authorizationHeader) {
      return res
        .status(401)
        .json({ status: 401, message: 'Access Denied. No token provided.' });
    }

    // Extract the token from the Bearer scheme
    const token = authorizationHeader.split(' ')[1];

    // Verify the token
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);

    // Check if the token exists in the database and is still valid
    const tokenDocument = await Token.findOne({ token: token });
    if (!tokenDocument || new Date() > tokenDocument.expires) {
      return res
        .status(401)
        .json({ status: 401, message: 'Invalid token or token has expired.' });
    }

    // Attach the decoded user information to the request object
    req.user = decoded;

    // Proceed to the next middleware or route handler
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors that occur during token verification
    console.error('Token verification error:', error);
    return res.status(400).json({ status: 400, message: 'Invalid token.' });
  }
};

module.exports = verifyToken;
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Functionality

1. **Token Extraction**:

   - The middleware checks for an `Authorization` header in the incoming request. If not found, it responds with a `401 Access Denied` message.

2. **Token Splitting**:

   - It splits the header value to extract the token, assuming it's in the format `Bearer <token>`.

3. **Verification**:

   - The token is verified using `jsonwebtoken` and a secret key (`process.env.JWT_SECRET`).

4. **Database Validation**:

   - It checks if the token exists in the database (using a Mongoose model `Token`) and ensures it's not expired.

5. **Request Augmentation**:

   - If the token is valid, it attaches the decoded token data to the `req.user`, allowing subsequent middleware and routes to access user information.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - If any step fails (missing token, invalid token, expired token), appropriate HTTP status codes and messages are returned.

## üöÄ Usage

- **Importing**: This middleware should be imported and used in your routes where authentication is necessary.

```javascript
const verifyToken = require('./middlewares/authMiddleware');

// Use it as a middleware in your routes
app.get('/protected-route', verifyToken, (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route');
});
```

## üîê Security

- **JWT Secret**: Ensure that you set a strong and secure JWT secret in your environment variables (`process.env.JWT_SECRET`).
- **Token Expiry**: Regularly check and enforce token expiry to enhance security.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

- **401 Unauthorized**: Returned if no token is provided or the token is invalid or expired.
- **400 Bad Request**: Returned if there is a general error in token verification.

This middleware is crucial for securing routes in your application, ensuring that only authenticated users gain access to protected resources.

### `handleValidationErrors`

This middleware function is designed to catch and handle errors resulting from the validation checks applied by `validateConsentFormUpdate`.

- **Functionality**: It checks for any validation errors recorded during the request processing. If errors are found, it sends a `400 Bad Request` response with a detailed list of errors, allowing the client to correct the input data.

## Usage

To use this middleware in your Express application, simply import the `validateConsentFormUpdate` and `handleValidationErrors` functions and apply them to routes that require consent form data validation.

```javascript
const {
  validateConsentFormUpdate,
  handleValidationErrors,
} = require('./middlewares/consentFormValidatorMiddleware');

app.post(
  '/consent-form',
  validateConsentFormUpdate,
  handleValidationErrors,
  (req, res) => {
    // Handle the request after successful validation
  },
);
```

---

This middleware is essential for maintaining high data quality and preventing invalid data from entering the system, thereby ensuring that all consent forms are complete and correctly filled out.

# `server.js` Documentation üìÑüöÄ

The `server.js` file is the entry point for the "Wellbility State School Backend" application. It sets up the Express server, connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, configures middleware, and defines the basic routes for the application. Below is a detailed breakdown of its components and functionalities.

## Table of Contents

1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Environment Configuration](#environment-configuration)
3. [Middleware Setup](#middleware-setup)
4. [Database Connection](#database-connection)
5. [Routes Configuration](#routes-configuration)
6. [Starting the Server](#starting-the-server)

## Overview

The `server.js` file initializes an Express application and configures it to connect to a MongoDB database. It also sets up middleware for handling JSON requests, CORS for cross-origin resource sharing, and includes routing for various endpoints.

## Environment Configuration

```javascript
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();
```

- **dotenv**: Used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. This allows sensitive information, such as database URLs and server ports, to be kept out of the source code.

## Middleware Setup

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json({ limit: '50mb' }));
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ limit: '50mb', extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors({ origin: '*' }));
```

- **Body Parser**: Handles JSON and URL-encoded data with a size limit of 50mb, which is useful for handling large payloads.
- **CORS**: Configured to allow requests from any origin, which is important for developing applications that might be accessed from different domains.

## Database Connection

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose
  .connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL, {
    serverApi: { version: '1', strict: true, deprecationErrors: true },
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Connected to MongoDB using Mongoose!');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB:', error);
  });
```

- **Mongoose**: Connects to MongoDB using a URL provided in the environment variables. The connection is configured to use the latest server API version for better compatibility and error handling.

## Routes Configuration

```javascript
const authRoutes = require('./routes/auth');
const indexRouter = require('./routes/index');

app.use('/api', indexRouter);
app.use('/auth', authRoutes);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello New World!');
});
```

- **Auth Routes**: Handles authentication-related endpoints like login and registration.
- **Index Router**: Includes various application routes, organized for easier management.
- **Root Route**: A simple endpoint that returns a greeting message to verify that the server is running.

## Starting the Server

```javascript
app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${process.env.PORT}`);
});
```

- **Port Configuration**: The server listens on a port specified in the environment variables, allowing it to be easily changed without modifying the code.

This setup provides a robust foundation for running the backend server, handling HTTP requests, and managing data interactions with a MongoDB database. üöÄüåê
